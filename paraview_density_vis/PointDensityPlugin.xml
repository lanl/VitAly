          long_help="vtkPointDensityFilter is a filter that generates a density field on a volume from a point cloud. Basically the density is computed as number of points in a local neighborhood per unit volume; or optionally, the number of points in a local neighborhood surrounding each voxel. The local neighborhood is specified as a radius around each sample position (i.e., each voxel) which can be of fixed value; or the radius can be relative to the voxel size. The density computation may be further weighted by a scalar value which is simply multiplied by each point's presumed density of 1.0."
